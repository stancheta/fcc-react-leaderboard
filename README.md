# FCC-DataVis-Boilerplate This is a simple boilerplate for the challenges on [FreeCodeCamp's](https://www.freecodecamp.com/) Data Visualization Path. It was made by ejecting Facebook/React team's fantastic [Create React App](https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2016/07/22/create-apps-with-no-configuration.html) and adding some extra lines on the Webpack config file to support SASS/SCSS.

 Here is a link to Create React App's original [README](https://github.com/facebookincubator/create-react-app/blob/master/README.md).

 Since this is here mainly so that I can work on my Data Visualization challenges,
 I have totally ignored the production side of things. If there is anything that
 you find to make this boilerplate better, feel free to send a pull request.
